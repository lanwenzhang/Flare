## Features
- GPU-driven rendering
  - Frustum culling
  - Occlusion culling
  - Indirect draw
- Deferred shading
- Physically based rendering
- Image-based lighting
- Dynamic diffuse global illumination
- Ground-truth ambient occlusion
- Ray-traced soft shadow
- Spatiotemporal variance-guided filtering
- Temporal anti-aliasing
- ACES tone mapping
- Real-time UI
- GPU profiler

## To do
- Asynchronous loading
- Multi-threaded command recording
- Mesh shader
- Clustered rendering
- Screen space reflections

## Usage
* `W`/`A`/`S`/`D` - camera movement
* `LMB` - hold to look around
* `F1` - toggle UI
* `F2` - toggle GPU profiler
